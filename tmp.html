        <td>This paper presents a comparative analysis of total cost of ownership (TCO) and performance between domain-adapted large language models (LLM) and state-of-the-art (SoTA) LLMs , with a particular emphasis on tasks related to coding assistance for chip design. We examine the TCO and performance metrics of a domain-adaptive LLM, ChipNeMo, against two leading LLMs, Claude 3 Opus and ChatGPT-4 Turbo, to assess their efficacy in chip design coding generation.
Through a detailed evaluation of the accuracy of the model, training methodologies, and operational expenditures, this study aims to provide stakeholders with critical information to select the most economically viable and performance-efficient solutions for their specific needs. Our results underscore the benefits of employing domain-adapted models, such as ChipNeMo, that demonstrate improved performance at significantly reduced costs compared to their general-purpose counterparts. In particular, we reveal the potential of domain-adapted LLMs to decrease TCO by approximately 90%-95%, with the cost advantages becoming increasingly evident as the deployment scale expands. With expansion of deployment, the cost benefits of ChipNeMo become more pronounced, making domain-adaptive LLMs an attractive option for organizations with substantial coding needs supported by LLMs</td>

        <td>Lei Zhang, Kaixin Bai, Guowen Huang, Zhenshan Bing, Zhaopeng Chen, Alois Knoll, Jianwei Zhang</td>
        <td>The deep learning models has significantly advanced dexterous manipulation techniques for multi-fingered hand grasping. However, the contact information-guided grasping in cluttered environments remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we have developed a method for generating multi-fingered hand grasp samples in cluttered settings through contact semantic map. We introduce a contact semantic conditional variational autoencoder-based generative model to predict the optimal grasps. Our grasp generation method has demonstrated remarkable success, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by at least 4.65% with 81.0% average grasping success rate in real-world single-object environment and 75.3% grasping success rate in cluttered scenes.</td>

        <td>Cláudio Gomes, João Paulo Fernandes, Gabriel Falcao, Soummya Kar, Sridhar Tayur</td>
        <td>The rapid adoption of Electric Vehicles (EVs) poses challenges for electricity grids to accommodate or mitigate peak demand. Vehicle-to-Vehicle Charging (V2VC) has been recently adopted by popular EVs, posing new opportunities and challenges to the management and operation of EVs. We present a novel V2VC model that allows decision-makers to take V2VC into account when optimizing their EV operations. We show that optimizing V2VC is NP-Complete and find that even small problem instances are computationally challenging. We propose R-V2VC, a heuristic that takes advantage of the resulting totally unimodular constraint matrix to efficiently solve problems of realistic sizes.</td>
